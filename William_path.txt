Alex is a senior majoring in EECS at UC Berkeley. He loves \textbf{\textit{Hiking}} and traveling alone. Once two weeks Alex will go to Yosemite by himself to go hike those real crazy hard trails because he is really confident about his hiking skills. Alex is too arrogant that he never brings his bear spray even though he knows it’s highly possible to encounter a bear when doing solo hike. He just hates hiking with people that he thinks that everyone’s pace is slower than his and he has to take care of everyone which he thinks it's a waste of time. \\

	\indent As usual Alex wakes up at 6 in the morning and is ready to do his favorite activity -- \textbf{Solo Hike}. He drives all the way to Yosemite, getting the park permission and are all set to challenge the most difficult hiking trail in Yosemite -- \textbf{The Bear Claw}. The Bear Claw trail is known to be extremely difficult for solo hikers. The grizzly Bear’s footprints, the scratches on the tree made by bear’s claw are all over the pathway. However, Alex is not afraid of anything; he claims that he can kill a grizzly bear without using any tools, As Alex starts hiking, he hears bear’s roars and and sees bear all over the mountain. But he’s still not afraid of them. Halfway through his walk, he sees a huge, bulky grizzly bear staring at him, hissing and giving warnings to the unwelcome stranger not to get closer to its territory, However, the arrogant Cal student refuses to obey the signal and decides to challenge the bear. As Alex keeps walking towards the brutal creature, the bear launches a surprise attack, giving Alex a huge scratch right across his chest. The aggressive grizzly bear knocks Alex down and and soon it leaves the place. When Alex wakes up the following day, he realizes that there is something wrong with his body. He found out that he can, in fact, transforms into a bear whenever he likes.


Once back in Berkeley, Alex began to shy away from the responsibility that his new bear powers had given him. As an EECS major, Alex always knew he would be a \textit {god amongst \emph {men}, a king amongst \emph {peasants} and a genius amongst \emph {plebeians} but he was afraid} of the responsibilities. He feared having to use the powers for reasons other than \textbf {beating up bullies that made fun of him, attacking professors for giving him ninety-nine instead of one hundred on exams and eating other EECS students that were in competition for internships} would impose too large a burden for him to handle. The possibility of using his bear powers for good was \textbf {out of the question.} Alex suppressed his urge to go \textit {full bear} and instead decided to dedicate his life to his studies so he could graduate and rule the world one technology company at a time. 



Passing through Sproul plaza in the afternoon, Alex saw a group of protesters advocating people to kill bears. They claimed that bear is a dangerous animal that we might risk our lives if we encounter bears in the wild, or even in the bear territory -- our main campus.
  

Given his new connection to the bear community, Alex is outraged by the protesters. He decides he wants to teach them a lesson about the \textbf{mighty power of bears!} Alex walks to the other side of Sproul hall where he can remain out of sight, and transforms into a formidable Grizzly. Once in full form, he runs back to the protest and unleashes a horrifying roar! Chaos ensues as people run in all directions in hope of safety. However, the protest’s leader stands his ground. As he stands on the steps of upper Sproul, he turns to Alex and directs his hate speech toward him. Furious at the arrogance of this bigot, Alex charges him. Although the police were on site, they did not have time to stop Alex before he sunk his claws and teeth into the protester’s shoulder and torso. The protester unleashed horrible screams as he was whipped back and forth by the bear’s superior strength. Alex releases the dead man and tries to flee toward Strawberry Creek. But now that the police have had time to organize, they are prepared. Unsurprisingly, the officers did not expect any kind of bear attack and thus did not carry with them any appropriate tranquilizers. They were left with only one option… \textbf{/emp{shoot the bear dead.}} So, just as Alex was approaching Sather Gate, one brave officer aimed, and shot the bear dead with one bullet. In the end, instead of helping fight the hateful messages being said about bears, Alex died only to strengthen their cause. 

In the end, in order to signify the importance of the \textbf{Bear Hero} Alex and the achievement Alex has done to UC Berkeley community, the chancellor and board of directors decide to establish a monument for Alex outside memorial glade, to commemorate his ephemeral but shining life.
